# questions-and-file

[ONLY FOR REFERENCES. Ask questions upon your own caution]

Finding the target market is critical for any retail corporate. Based on my research, target has more shoppers who are “female, younger and chic”1, comparing to Walmart and Kohl’s, and Kmart. Has this market strategy changed, or will it change in the next five years?
Target is dedicated to provide a higher end shopping experiences for its customers. If the economic environment is going downturn, how would target change its strategy to attract more customers if fewer customers are looking for higher-end shopping experiences?
Given more and more e-commerce tech companies are emerging and competing with traditional retail companies, would target take any actions to adapt itself in the retail industry?
1.	If they say, they would be attracting more digital customers, then would target put emphasis on its digital platforms in the future? [they claimed to have a blend of digital and physical experiences]
2.	If they say, they would be optimizing their real world shopping experiences: Given Target customers are younger population who are also avid digital customers and spent a big amount of time online. How would target maintain this population to shop in person?
